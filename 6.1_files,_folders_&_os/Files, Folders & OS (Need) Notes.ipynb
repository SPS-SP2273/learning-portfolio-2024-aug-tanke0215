This can be specified absolutely (e.g. ``C:\\\\Users\\Tan\\Desktop\\text\\.txt`` on Windows), or relatively.\n","## 1.2 More about relative paths\n","Relative paths enable us to specifiy a location without having to type the exact address of where a file exists on the computer. A relative path is relative to the current directory where your program is stored. Let us familiarise ourselves with some notation.\n","\n","| **Notation** |    **Meaning**    |\n","|:------------:|:-----------------:|\n","|       .      | Current directory |\n","|      ..      |  Parent directory |\n","\n","Say, our folder is the below. \n","\n","```\n","C:\\\\\\Users\\Tan\\Desktop\\\n","    Project  \n","        Data \n","            Data.csv \n","        Program \n","            Test.py <-- current program that is open\n","            Text.txt\n","``` \n","\n","To access Text.txt, the absolute path is ``C:\\\\Users\\Tan\\Desktop\\Project\\Program\\Text.txt`` but the relative path is ``.\\Text.txt``, with the ``.`` indicating that the file is located within the current directory. However, by default, the program automatically searches for files with the name Text.txt in the current directory anyway, so this is redundant. This would be useful if there are further sub-directories under Program.\n","\n","To access Data.csv, the absolute path is ``C:\\\\\\Users\\Tan\\Desktop\\Project\\Data\\Data.csv`` but the relative path is ``..\\Data\\Data.csv``.\n","\n","### macOS or Linux\n","macOS and Linux allow you to use ``~`` to refer to your home directory. So, for example, you can access the Desktop in these systems ‘relatively’ with ``~/Desktop``. To access Text.txt in the example above, it would just be ``~Desktop\\Project\\Text.txt``.\n","\n","## 1.3 Path separator\n","Windows uses ``\\`` as the path separator while macOS (or Linux) uses ``/``. So, the absolute path to a file on the Desktop on each of these systems will look like this:\n","\n","Windows\t``C:\\\\Users\\chammika\\Desktop\\data-01.txt``\n","macOS (or Linux)    ``/Users/chammika/Desktop/data-01.txt``\n","\n","If you want to share your code and want it to work on both systems, **you must not hardcode either path separator**.\n","\n","## 1.4 Text files vs. Binary files\n","All files on a computer are either text files or binary files. Text files are simple and can be opened, and their contents examined by almost any software e.g. Notepad, TextEdit, Jupiter etc. Examples of text file formats are ``.txt``, ``.md`` or ``.csv``.\n","\n","Binary files, in contrast, require some processing to make sense of what they contain. For example, the raw data of a ``.png`` file is gibberish. In addition, some binary files will only run on specific OSs. For example, ``Excel.app`` on a Mac will not run on Windows, nor will ``Excel.exe`` run on macOS (or Linux),\n","## 1.5 Extensions\n","Files are usually named to end with an extension separated from the name by a ``.`` like ``name.extension``. This extension lets the OS know what software or app to use to extract the details in a file.\n","\n","For example, a ``.xlsx`` means use Excel or ``.pptx`` means use PowerPoint."]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 2 Opening and closing files"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.1 Reading data"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["## 2.2 Writing data"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["### Writing to a file in one go"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":202,"id":"123456","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Your code here\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["### Writing to a file, line by line"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":203,"id":"123456","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Your code here\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 3 Some useful packages"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 4 OS safe paths"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 5 Folders"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["## 5.1 Creating folders"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["## 5.2 Checking for existence"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["### Using try-except"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":204,"id":"123456","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Your code here\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["### Using os.path.exists()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":205,"id":"123456","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","# Your code here\n"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["## 5.3 Copying files"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 6 Listing and looking for files"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 7 Extracting file info"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"123456","metadata":{},"source":["# 8 Deleting stuff"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.2"},"toc":{"base_numbering":1,"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":false,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":false,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":false},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"31f2aee4e71d21fbe5cf8b01ff0e069b9275f58929596ceb00d14d90e3e16cd6"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
